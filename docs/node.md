# 1. Node and front end development environment

As a first step in this course we will go through Node as a development environment and the basics of handling web sites and javascript projects. 


1. Install NodeJs

2. Clone this repo:
    1. create a projects folder or use an existing one
    2. run command: git clone https://github.com/filinils/FrontEndSeries.git
    3. Checkout a new branch: git checkout -b \<your branch\>
 
3. Initiate projects
    1. In the folder "simpleEnv" there is a example project setup. 
    2. Navigate to "client" folder from terminal/cmd
    3. Run "npm install"
    4. Run "npm start"

    This should start a webpack project.

4. Navigate to "server" folder
    1. run "npm install"

    This should start a simple example express server.
   
5. Optional steps: 
    
    1. Start mapping out you "index.html" file with tags. 
    2. Start create som basic styling.
    3. Try consuming the express(/api/experience) api endpoint from JavScript without adding any libraries.(Hint: figure out a way of allowing "CORS")
    4. Present the result on your page.
